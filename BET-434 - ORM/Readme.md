# Introduction
ORM (Object Relational Mapping) is the use of an object-oriented language to write database queries instead of raw SQL, it has features like seeding, streaming, defining relationships, etc.

### Pros of using an ORM
* Abstraction of the database system, making it easier and less intimidating to interact with a database.
* out of the box features, cutting down development time
* Relatively easier to use than SQL because of prior knowledge in the programming language
* Cleaner, and better designed code.
### Cons of using an ORM
* The potential learning curve that require getting used to.
* Some SQL queries can be faster than their ORM counterparts
* The initial, potentially complex configurationLanguage: /
