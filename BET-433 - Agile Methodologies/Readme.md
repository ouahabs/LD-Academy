# Introduction
This readme will include notes on SCRUM, Kanban & Lean, TDD, OKRs, about information from the links above, as well as any additional research that will be included below.

# Agile
## Principles
* Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery 
* Welcoming change at any stage 
* Frequent delivery (as short of a deadline as possible)
* Daily collaboration between business people and devs
* Build around motivated people, and trust 
* Face-to-face conversation is more efficient
* Working software is the primary measure of progress
* Constance pace of development
* Continuous attention to technical and design excellence
* Simplicity
* self-organizing teamms
* Regular self reflection on the team's efficiency

# Scrum
The most frequently chosen method by teams, and it adopts a few ceremonies or plans:
* Backlog grooming
* Sprint planning
* Daily standup/scrum
* Sprint review
* Sprint retrospective
This produces artifacts like a sprint backlog, a project backlog, etc. more in the references.

# Kanban
Another popular framework used to enhance communication and overall team performance through clarity and simplicity, it features a board f tasks and work items and splits them into clear categories (e.g, to-do, doing/in progress, done, to-review, etc), this is called a kanban board.

# TDD
Test Driven Development, it's an agile approach that enforces and insists on the use of unit tests along every step of the development process, usually before even writing the real code, iteratively, and with feedback, actively avoiding fauly code.

# OKRs
OKRs stand for **Objectives and Key Results**, a collaborative goal-setting methodology used by teams and individuals to set challenging, ambitious goals with measurable results. OKRs are how you track progress, create alignment, and encourage engagement around measurable goals.

OKRs are typically written with an Objective at the top and 3-5 supporting Key Results below it. They can also be written as a statement:

_I will (Objective) as measured by (Key Results)._

For example, “I will fix the website for the vast majority of people as measured by 7 out of 10 people being able to get through, a 1-second response time, and a 1% error rate.”
